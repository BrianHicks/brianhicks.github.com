Definition
----------

> Machine learning: field of study taht gives computers the ability to learn
> without being explicitly programmed.

Arthur Samuel

In the 1950s Samuel wrote a program that would learn to play checkers by
itself, and could eventually beat it's creator (even though Samuel wasn't very
good at checkers.)

or...

> Well-post Learning Problem: A computer program is said to *learn* from
> experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if
> its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Tom Mitchell

So in checkers:

 - `E` is the experience of playing checkers
 - `T` is playing games of checkers
 - `P` is the win/loss percentage

Types of ML
-----------

Supervised learning: teach the computer how to do something

Unsupervised learning: the computer learns by itself

Other Terms
-----------

 - reinforcement learning
 - recommender systems

This class will talk a lot about practical advice for applying learning
algorithms. Huge different between people who have algorithm knowledge, but
cannot apply them and those who know and can.
