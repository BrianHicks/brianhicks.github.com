Why is ML Prevalent?
--------------------

 - Grew out of work in AI
   - AI programs didn't work for complex tasks
   - Best way to do complex tasks was to make computers learn
 - New capability for computers

Examples of modern ML
---------------------

Database mining
 - larger database sets
   - web click/clickstream data
   - medical records (find correlations 'n such)
     - turn medical records into medical knowledge (data -> info)
   - biology & engineering

Applications which can't be worked by hand
 - autonomous helicopters learning to fly themselves

Self-customizing programs
 - recommendation engines

Understand human learning. Brain and real AI.
